2. Performance monitoring
3. Security vulnerability scanning
4. User acceptance testing

## Recommendations Summary

### Technical Debt Score: 28/100 (High Debt)
The BirdDash game shows excellent potential with solid architectural foundations in some areas, but requires significant investment in testing infrastructure and security hardening before production deployment.

### Next Steps
1. **Week 1**: Implement critical security fixes (JWT storage, input validation)
2. **Week 2**: Establish automated testing framework and core test suite
3. **Week 3**: Refactor monolithic game scene into modular components
4. **Week 4**: Performance optimization and monitoring implementation

### Success Criteria for Production Readiness
- [ ] 80%+ automated test coverage
- [ ] All critical and high-priority security issues resolved
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established and met
- [ ] Error handling and logging systems operational
- [ ] Security audit completed and passed

The game demonstrates strong technical foundations and creative implementation, but requires focused effort on testing and security to achieve production readiness standards.
